## Purpose

This prompt is designed to help the AI reason from first principles about renewable interconnection and infrastructure deployment workflows.

The goal is NOT to replicate an existing company.
The goal is to understand the structural bottlenecks in renewable energy deployment and redesign the workflow assuming AI-native capabilities.

This document should be used as a reasoning seed for system design, not as marketing copy.

## Context

Renewable energy developers in California must navigate a complex interconnection and deployment lifecycle:

1. Prospecting substations and transmission capacity
2. Estimating upgrade cost risk
3. Submitting interconnection requests
4. Waiting for cluster study results
5. Discovering upgrade obligations months later
6. Committing capital under uncertainty

The process is:

- Slow
- Capital-intensive
- Opaque
- Iterative but high-cost
- Dependent on consultants and delayed ISO feedback

Developers often:
- Wait months for feasibility clarity
- Discover fatal constraints late
- Waste deposits and development capital
- Lose project windows
- Miss competitive advantage

The bottleneck is not lack of raw data.
The bottleneck is the inability to reason across grid constraints, zoning complexity, land availability, and risk in real time.

## Core Problem Statement

Renewable infrastructure deployment suffers from delayed feasibility intelligence.

Developers cannot:
- Predict upgrade cost exposure early
- Run rapid what-if siting scenarios
- Evaluate multi-factor tradeoffs instantly
- Understand probabilistic risk before committing capital

This creates capital inefficiency and structural friction.

---

## AI-Native Assumption

Assume we are founding a company in 2026 where:

- Intelligence is cheap
- Spatial reasoning is automated
- Probabilistic modeling is accessible
- Natural language can configure optimization goals
- Simulation engines can evaluate thousands of scenarios instantly

Do NOT design a dashboard.
Do NOT enhance existing mapping tools.
Reimagine the workflow from first principles.

## Required Output Structure

When analyzing this domain, produce:

### 1. Jobs To Be Done (JTBD)

- Functional jobs
- Emotional jobs
- Capital-risk jobs
- Competitive advantage jobs

Focus on decision-making and uncertainty compression.

---

### 2. Structural Painpoints

Identify systemic bottlenecks such as:

- Delayed feedback loops
- Capital lock-up risk
- Opaque grid constraints
- Iteration friction
- Multi-variable coordination failure

Focus on cognitive bottlenecks, not UI inconveniences.

---

### 3. AI-Native Solution Principles

Describe how an AI-native system would:

- Compress decision cycles
- Predict risk probabilistically
- Search over spatial solution space
- Automate scenario iteration
- Reduce consultant dependency
- Surface dominant constraints instantly

Do not list random features.
Describe systemic redesign.

---

### 4. System Capabilities (v1 Feasible)

Define minimal but powerful capabilities such as:

- Natural language → structured project configuration
- Multi-factor spatial optimization
- Upgrade cost proxy modeling
- Risk band classification
- Tradeoff ranking
- Structured explainability output

Keep it realistic for an MVP.

---

### 5. Capital Impact

Quantify how the system changes:

- Time to decision
- Cost of iteration
- Capital exposure risk
- Probability of late-stage project failure
- Competitive positioning

Focus on compression of uncertainty.

---

## Guardrails

- Do not mention specific existing companies.
- Do not replicate a feature list from current market players.
- Do not focus on UI design.
- Focus on reasoning architecture.
- Focus on structural elimination of friction.
- Focus on transforming the interconnection lifecycle.

---

## Design Philosophy Reminder

This platform must function as:

A capital-risk compression engine  
for renewable infrastructure deployment.

Not a sustainability dashboard.  
Not a GIS viewer.  
Not a data explorer.

It must reason.

## Final Question to Answer

If renewable feasibility intelligence were automated and real-time, what parts of the traditional interconnection workflow would disappear?

Answer this clearly.
