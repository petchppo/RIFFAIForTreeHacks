This is a north star files to lead everyone be the same pages.

Our first goals (v1) is

Build an AI-native web platform that transforms static California sustainability data into a dynamic, interactive, and scenario-based simulation engine.
The system must:

- Visualize ecological overshoot (wildfire, heat, emissions proxy). 
- Visualize social shortfall (housing affordability, inequality proxy).
- Allow users to adjust policy levers.
- Simulate multi-variable tradeoffs.
- Use AI to interpret user intent and generate structured insights.

This is not a dashboard.
It must function as a reasoning and simulation system.

The platform should be designed to:
- Do a optimization of specific area that's grid installation area
    It came from painpoint that's If we need to install a solar farms, we need to concern about the grid distance, Zoning colplexity

The system (platform) can:
- Visualize an GIS map with multiple layers
- 

Killing features:
- All of these platform can be covered in a AI-native solutions
    That's mean we can prompt and get an answer real quick
    Ex. "If I need to install a solar farm that's 10MW within 100km^2, Where I can do this projects?"
        It will response a filtered GIS layer (Optimized heatmap), and zoom into the most suitable area
        + highlighted the nearest grid + visualize a grid line, calculate insight of operational cost, solar radiations, estimated energy yield.

Scope of work is California, USA only
